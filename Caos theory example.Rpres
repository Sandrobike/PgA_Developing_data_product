A mathematical model of bacterial growth in a resource-limited environment

========================================================


- The plot presented on the next slides is a mathematical model of bacterial growth in a resource-limited environment. The ordinate shows the percentage of population possible on the basis of the actual available resources.
- When the bacteria reproduction constant is below 3 the bacteria population find a stable population percentage equilibrium. 
- for values > 3 and < 3.6 the population is unstable with a periodic behavior
- for values > 3.6 the population became caotic, that is: completely irregular and apparently random.



R Code of mathematical model
========================================================

```{r}
caos <- function(n = 100, k, init) {
    x <- rep(0,n)
    x[1] <- init
    for (i in 1:(n-1)) {
        x[i+1] <- k*x[i]*(1 - x[i])
        if (x[i+1] < 0) x[i+1] <- 0
        if (x[i+1] > 1) x[i+1] <- 1
    }
    x
}
n <- 200
Population <- caos(n, 4, 0.001)
t <- seq(0,by=20,length.out = n)
```

Plot and histogram of population ratio  
========================================================


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
plot(t,Population, type = "l",pch=10, ylim = c(0,1), 
     main = "Population ratio growth")
# draw the histogram of the population trend
        hist(Population,breaks = 20, main = "Polulation ratio Histogram")
```

In this case k= 4 and the trend is caotic 


Conclusions
========================================================
- The graph and histogram make this data look random, where the histogram is very similar to a beta distribution. The beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of percentages and proportions
(see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution>).
- In reality the behavior is absolutely deterministic and similar to weather forecast where it is not possible to predict the long-term weather because it is not possible to know perfectly the initial conditions. In 1972 Edward Lorentz to underline this topic wrote: 
does the flap of a butterflyâ€™s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?
